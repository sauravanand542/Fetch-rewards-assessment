# Fetch-rewards-assessment
The ER diagram contains the Relational Database diagram. This will help you understand the realtionships among the datasets provided.

The "fetch assessment" python notebook contains all teh code that has been used to create tables from json format and run SQL queries. Questions on data quality, SQL query and message to stakeholders are answered here. I have used PostgreSQL to run SQL queries on the database.
